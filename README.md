Code designed to run/generate probabilistic tornado forecasts at NOAA/ESRL. Not very useful without direct access to the forecast data or premade data, but this is more of an example of the code I wrote for my dissertation research.

An example of the output can be found here: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/forecasts/reforecast2/tornado/
